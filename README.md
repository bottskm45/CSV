## Self-Reflection
Working through the CSV and pandas assignments taught me that the tiniest details really matter when processing data. I learned that even small things—like stripping extra spaces or converting data types correctly—can make a big difference in making my code work as expected. Debugging issues, such as interpreting dates the right way or ensuring numeric values aren't accidentally treated as text, reinforced my attention to detail and patience. Overall, this exercise not only improved my technical skills in data manipulation but also reminded me that every error is an opportunity to learn and get better.
